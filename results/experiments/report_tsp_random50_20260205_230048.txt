LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The Genetic Algorithm (GA) achieved a good balance between exploration and exploitation, resulting in a satisfactory solution with a fitness value of 583.0556 within a reasonable computation time of 25.73s.
Key Observations:
  * The convergence history shows a steady decrease in fitness values, indicating that the GA effectively explored the solution space.
  * The final fitness value is significantly better than the initial values, suggesting that the GA made meaningful improvements throughout the optimization process.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the population size to a larger value (e.g., 100) to potentially improve the quality of the solution.
  * Adjust the crossover probability to a higher value (e.g., 0.8) to increase the diversity of the offspring.
  * Consider using a more advanced mutation strategy, such as the 'uniform mutation' or 'non-uniform mutation', to further improve the solution quality.
  * Try using a hybrid approach by combining the GA with a local search method, such as the 2-opt refinement, to further refine the solution.
  * Experiment with different parameter configurations, such as varying the mutation probability or using a different selection method, to identify the most effective settings for this specific problem instance.
