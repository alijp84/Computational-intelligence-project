=====================================
Problem: OPTIMIZATION - ackley_10d
Timestamp: 2026-02-05T23:02:58.570146
Total Execution Time: 39.39 seconds
Iterations Completed: 2

BEST SOLUTION
-------------
Method: ParticleSwarmOptimization
Fitness/Quality: 0.0000
Computation Time: 6.40s
Iterations to Convergence: 336

ITERATION SUMMARY
-----------------
Iteration 1: PSO        | Fitness:   0.0000 | Rating: ACCEPTABLE | Time: 25.30s
Iteration 2: GA         | Fitness:      inf | Rating: ACCEPTABLE | Time: 14.08s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The GA method was able to converge to infinity in 0 iterations, but this may be due to the high dimensionality and deceptive nature of the Ackley function. Further analysis is needed to determine the true performance of the method.
Key Observations:
  * Convergence history is not available
  * Best fitness is infinity, indicating that the method may have not fully converged
  * Computation time is 0 seconds, suggesting that the method may have not fully explored the search space

Recommendations:
  * Tune the population size to 100 and the mutation rate to 0.1
  * Try using a different method, such as PSO or DE, to compare performance
  * Consider using a hybrid approach, such as using GA for 10 iterations and then switching to 2-opt refinement
