ITERATION SUMMARY
-----------------
Iteration 1: PSO        | Fitness:  11.9395 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 25.60s
Iteration 2: PSO        | Fitness:  19.9039 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 29.28s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The PSO algorithm achieved a good balance between exploration and exploitation, resulting in a satisfactory solution within the time limit.
Key Observations:
  * The convergence history indicates a stable and consistent improvement in the best fitness value over the last 5 iterations.
  * The computation time of 6.47s is reasonable for the given problem size and method.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the number of particles to 150 to further improve exploration and potentially find better solutions.
  * Consider increasing the number of iterations to 50 to see if a better solution can be found within the same time limit.
  * Try using a different initialization method, such as random or Latin Hypercube Sampling, to see if it improves the quality of the initial population.
  * Experiment with other optimization algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Simulated Annealing (SA), to compare their performance on this problem.
  * Consider using a hybrid approach, such as combining PSO with local search techniques like 2-opt refinement, to further improve the solution quality.
