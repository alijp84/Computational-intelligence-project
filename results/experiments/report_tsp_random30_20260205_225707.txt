ITERATION SUMMARY
-----------------
Iteration 1: ACO        | Fitness: 456.8803 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 18.84s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The algorithm achieved a good balance between exploration and exploitation, resulting in a high-quality solution within a reasonable computation time.
Key Observations:
  * The convergence history indicates that the algorithm converged to a stable solution within a few iterations.
  * The best fitness value of 456.8803 is a good indicator of the algorithm's performance on this instance.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the pheromone evaporation rate to a lower value (e.g., 0.1) to encourage more exploration and potentially improve the solution quality.
  * Increase the number of iterations to 100 to see if the algorithm can find an even better solution.
  * Consider using a different heuristic weight (e.g., 0.5) to balance the influence of pheromone trails and the heuristic function.
  * Try using a genetic algorithm (GA) with a population size of 100 and 100 generations, followed by a 2-opt refinement to further improve the solution.
  * Experiment with different ACO variants, such as MAX-MIN Ant System or Ant Colony System, to see if they perform better on this instance.
