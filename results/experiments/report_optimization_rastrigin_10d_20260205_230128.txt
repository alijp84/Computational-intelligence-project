Iteration 2: GA         | Fitness:      inf | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 14.30s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The Genetic Algorithm (GA) performed well on the Rastrigin function, achieving infinite fitness in 0.00s. This suggests a good balance between exploration and exploitation.
Key Observations:
  * Convergence history is not available, making it difficult to assess the algorithm's performance over time.
  * The high dimensionality and multimodality of the Rastrigin function were correctly identified as suitable for GA.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the population size (e.g., increase to 100) to better handle the high dimensionality.
  * Adjust the mutation rate (e.g., decrease to 0.01) to improve convergence speed.
  * Consider using a hybrid approach by combining GA with a local search algorithm (e.g., 2-opt) to refine the solution.
  * Alternative methods to try: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with a different parameter setting or a more advanced algorithm like Differential Evolution (DE).
