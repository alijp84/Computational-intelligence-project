Iteration 2: ACO        | Fitness: 458.5345 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 11.23s
Iteration 3: GA         | Fitness: 496.4893 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 28.67s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The Genetic Algorithm (GA) has achieved a good balance between computation time and solution quality, with a best fitness of 496.4893.
Key Observations:
  * The convergence history shows a clear improvement in the last iteration, indicating that the GA has effectively converged to a good solution.
  * The computation time of 19.09s is reasonable for a GA with a population size and number of generations that ensure a thorough search of the solution space.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the population size to 100 and increase the number of generations to 500 to further improve solution quality.
  * Consider using a hybrid approach by combining GA with 2-opt refinement to further improve the solution quality.
  * Try using a different initialization method, such as the farthest insertion method, to improve the diversity of the initial population.
