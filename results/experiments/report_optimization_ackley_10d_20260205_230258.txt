ITERATION SUMMARY
-----------------
Iteration 1: PSO        | Fitness:   1.6462 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 19.85s
Iteration 2: GA         | Fitness:      inf | Rating: POOR       | Time: 14.85s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The Genetic Algorithm (GA) failed to converge within the specified time limit of 30 iterations, indicating poor performance.
Key Observations:
  * The best fitness value is infinite, suggesting that the algorithm did not find a solution within the search space.
  * The convergence history is not available, making it difficult to analyze the algorithm's behavior.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the mutation rate to a lower value (e.g., 0.01) to encourage exploration and potentially escape local optima.
  * Increase the population size to 100 to provide more diversity and improve the chances of finding a solution.
  * Try a different optimization method, such as Simulated Annealing (SA) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which may be more effective for this problem.
  * Consider using a hybrid approach, such as combining GA with 2-opt refinement or a local search algorithm, to improve the solution quality.
