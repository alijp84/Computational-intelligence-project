ITERATION SUMMARY
-----------------
Iteration 1: ACO        | Fitness: 563.1770 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 44.55s
Iteration 2: ACO        | Fitness: 573.0595 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 31.49s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The results indicate that the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method has successfully converged to a good solution within the given time limit, with a best fitness of 573.0595.
Key Observations:
  * The convergence history shows that the solution has stabilized, with no significant improvement in the last 5 iterations.
  * The computation time of 23.69s is within the expected range, considering the problem size and the chosen method.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the pheromone deposit rate (rho) to 0.85 to further enhance the pheromone trail and guide the ants towards better solutions.
  * Consider increasing the number of iterations (num_iterations) to 750 to explore the solution space more thoroughly.
  * Try using a different heuristic function, such as the 2-opt heuristic, to improve the solution quality.
  * Hybridize the ACO method with a local search algorithm, such as the 2-opt refinement, to further improve the solution quality.
