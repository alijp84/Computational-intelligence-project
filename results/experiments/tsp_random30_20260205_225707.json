The problem size is moderate, and ACO's ability to efficiently explore the solution space makes it a good fit. The parameters are set to balance exploration and exploitation: a moderate number of ants, a reasonable number of iterations, and pheromone evaporation and deposit rates that encourage exploration and exploitation, respectively. The heuristic weight is set to 1.0 to emphasize the pheromone trails. The tour length limit is set to 10000 to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in an infinite loop.",
