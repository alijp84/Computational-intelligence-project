ITERATION SUMMARY
-----------------
Iteration 1: PSO        | Fitness:   0.0000 | Rating: ACCEPTABLE | Time: 15.03s
Iteration 2: GA         | Fitness:      inf | Rating: GOOD       | Time:  8.70s
Iteration 3: PSO        | Fitness:   0.0000 | Rating: GOOD       | Time: 23.75s

LLM INSIGHTS
------------
Final Assessment: The results show a good convergence to the global optimum, with a best fitness of 0.0000 and a moderate number of iterations (208).
Key Observations:
  * The convergence history shows a steady decrease in fitness values over the last 5 iterations.
  * The computation time of 3.41s is relatively fast for a 10D optimization problem.

Recommendations:
  * Tune the number of particles (np) to 50-100 for better exploration-exploitation balance.
  * Reduce the velocity limit (w) to 0.5-0.7 to improve convergence speed.
  * Consider using a hybrid approach with a local search method (e.g., 2-opt) to refine the solution.
  * Try alternative methods like Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Differential Evolution (DE) to compare performance.
